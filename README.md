# 🎴 OpenYuGi

**OpenYuGi is a local-first Yu-Gi-Oh! collection manager, deck builder, and card-scanning application.** It runs as a NiceGUI web app on your own computer and stores your collection in readable files under `data/` — no hosted account, no external database, no cloud service holding your inventory hostage.

It is built for both **players** and **collectors**. Player-oriented views consolidate alternate printings so you can instantly answer *"do I own three copies?"*, while collector-oriented views preserve the exact set, rarity, artwork, condition, language, edition, value, and physical storage location of every single copy. 🗃️

## ✨ Highlights

OpenYuGi is a full workshop, not a single tool. Here is what lives inside — each area has a dedicated guide in [`docs/`](docs/Home.md) when you want to go deeper.

### 🗃️ Collection & inventory management

- Create separate collections for personal cards, trades, sealed products, or any workflow you like.
- Track printings by set code, rarity, and artwork rather than collapsing every copy into one record.
- Track physical entries by condition, language, first-edition status, storage location, quantity, purchase price, purchase date, and market value.
- Switch between **Consolidated / Player** mode and **Collector / Variant** mode.
- Search, filter, sort, and paginate large collections by card and printing metadata.
- Review total quantity, unique cards, unique variants, estimated value, rarity distribution, language distribution, and completion metrics on the dashboard.
- Undo supported collection and batch operations through the local changelog system. ↩️

### 🔍 Set browsing

- Browse the locally cached Yu-Gi-Oh! set database.
- Inspect the cards and rarities in a set.
- Compare a set checklist against a selected collection to see owned and missing printings.
- Download pack imagery or import set data from Yugipedia when the upstream database needs an addition.

### 📦 Physical storage

- Define binders, boxes, sealed products, and other storage locations inside a collection.
- Attach a description, image, or set association to a storage definition.
- Browse locations in gallery and detail views, including each location's assigned-card count.
- Move exact card entries between locations, including batch and drag-and-drop workflows.
- Rename a location while keeping its card assignments consistent.

### 🃏 Deck building

- Build Main, Extra, and Side Decks from the full card database.
- Compare deck requirements against a selected physical collection.
- Resolve alternate artwork IDs back to the base card identity for ownership and restriction checks.
- Import, save, organize, and export standard `.ydk` files.
- Export full decks or missing-card lists as YDK, CSV, JSON, or Cardmarket wants-list text.
- Download and enforce TCG, OCG, Goat, and Genesys restrictions; custom banlists can also be saved locally.
- Automatically route Extra Deck monster types and report deck or banlist violations.

### ⚡ High-volume entry & import

- Use the two-pane Bulk Add page to search the database and stage many collection changes quickly.
- Apply condition, language, edition, quantity, and storage metadata to batches.
- Import OpenYuGi JSON backups and Cardmarket PDF or text exports.
- Preview and correct parsed rows before committing them.
- Merge collections without requiring a server-side database.

### 🧩 Local database editing

- Correct local card metadata without waiting for an upstream data source.
- Add individual cards or sets from Yugipedia.
- Import Cardmarket information and maintain local pricing references.
- Keep collection files focused on owned-card state while joining card metadata at runtime.

### 📷 Webcam scanner (beta)

- Capture a card in the browser and process it entirely locally.
- Detect and flatten card boundaries using classic OpenCV or experimental YOLO preprocessing.
- Run EasyOCR and/or DocTR against the warped card.
- Detect likely set codes, names, edition text, rarity information, and card art.
- Compare art against an index built from `data/images/`.
- Pause for manual resolution when competing matches are too close.
- Inspect intermediate images, OCR output, confidence, and pipeline steps in the Debug Lab.

> The scanner is an assistive **beta** feature, not a guarantee of printing-level identification. Confirm ambiguous or valuable cards before committing them to a collection.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or newer** (Python 3.11 is the version used by the packaged-build workflow).
- **Git.**
- **A modern browser.**
- **An internet connection** for the initial card database download, image downloads, banlist refreshes, pricing data, and Yugipedia imports.
- **Additional disk space** if you download the full image cache, especially high-resolution images.

The scanner dependencies are included in `requirements.txt`. A CUDA-capable GPU can improve some model workloads but is not required. OpenYuGi uses EasyOCR and DocTR; it does **not** use Tesseract.

> 🐣 New to Python or the command line? The [Cross-Platform Beginner Tutorial](docs/Cross%E2%80%91Platform%20Beginner%20Tutorial%20to%20Run%20Yu%E2%80%91Gi%E2%80%91Oh%E2%80%91Card%E2%80%91Tracker%20on%20Windows%2C%20macOS%2C%20and%20Ubuntu%20Using%20Conda.md) walks through a full Conda setup on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu step by step, and there is a printable [beginner guide](docs/openyugi_beginner_guide.pdf) too.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DJ-Cat-N-Cheese/Yu-Gi-Oh-Card-Tracker.git
cd Yu-Gi-Oh-Card-Tracker
```

### 2. Create an isolated environment

Using Python's built-in virtual environment support:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it on Linux or macOS:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Activate it in Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Prefer Conda? That works too:

```bash
conda create -n openyugi python=3.11 -y
conda activate openyugi
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Torch, OCR, OpenCV, and Ultralytics make this a relatively large environment, so a longer install time and download size are normal. ☕

### 4. Run OpenYuGi

Run the application from the repository root so its relative data paths resolve correctly:

```bash
python main.py
```

NiceGUI normally opens the browser automatically. Otherwise, visit <http://localhost:8084>, sign in with `admin` / `admin`, and change the credentials in Settings. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## 🧭 First-run setup

Open **Settings** after signing in. The data-management actions let you prepare only the caches you need:

1. **Update card database** downloads metadata for the selected application language.
2. **Update all languages** downloads every supported language database.
3. **Download set info & images** refreshes set statistics and pack artwork.
4. **Download Yugipedia set images** fills or replaces pack artwork from Yugipedia.
5. **Download low-res card images** prepares a compact local card-image cache.
6. **Download high-res card images** uses substantially more time, bandwidth, and storage.
7. **Generate sample collection** creates example data for exploring the interface.

OpenYuGi also downloads individual card images lazily when they are requested, so a complete image download is optional. Once the required metadata and images are cached, routine collection and deck work can continue **offline**. Features that refresh external data still require a connection.

📖 For the full walkthrough of every toggle, see the [Settings guide](docs/Settings.md).

## 🖥️ Using the application

Every page below has a dedicated deep-dive guide in [`docs/`](docs/Home.md). This section is the quick tour.

### 📊 Dashboard

Your collection's overview. Select a collection to display unique-card and variant completion, total quantity, estimated Cardmarket-based value, and rarity and language charts. Its shortcuts lead straight into the main workflows. → [Dashboard guide](docs/Dashboard.md)

### 🗃️ Collection

The primary inventory editor.

- **Consolidated / Player view** groups all printings under the base card identity and emphasizes total ownership.
- **Collector / Variant view** separates exact printings and artwork variants for valuation and storage work.
- The detail view exposes entries for different conditions, languages, editions, and locations.
- Filters can be combined with ownership and sort controls.
- Collection files may be JSON, YAML, or YML, though JSON is the normal format.

Yu-Gi-Oh! APIs sometimes assign separate IDs to alternate artwork. OpenYuGi retains the printing's image ID while resolving gameplay-oriented counts to the base card where necessary. → [Collection guide](docs/Collection.md)

### 🔍 Browse Sets

A visual checklist. Select a collection, open a set, and compare its printings against what you own. The page can also import a missing set from Yugipedia. → [Browse Sets guide](docs/BrowseSets.md)

### 📦 Storage

Storage definitions belong to a collection. Create locations that mirror your room — for example `Trade Binder`, `Bulk Box A`, or `Deck Case` — then assign entries to them. Moving a card changes its location without losing printing, condition, language, or edition metadata. → [Storage guide](docs/Storage.md)

### 🃏 Deck Builder

Decks are saved as `.ydk` files under `data/decks/` and may be organized into groups. Select a collection to show ownership while building. Select a banlist to check classical copy limits or Genesys points. The export dialog can produce a complete deck or only the missing cards.

> Deck availability is advisory: always confirm the current official tournament policy and effective banlist before an event.

→ [Deck Builder guide](docs/DeckBuilder.md)

### ⚡ Bulk Add

Built for booster openings, purchased lots, and inventory corrections. Search the library on the left, stage or adjust collection entries on the right, and apply shared metadata in batches. The page records supported changes so the most recent action can be undone. → [Bulk Add guide](docs/BulkAdd.md)

### 📥 Import Tools

Import Tools accepts:

- an OpenYuGi JSON collection or scan export;
- Cardmarket PDF or text exports; and
- another local collection for merging.

Review the preview before committing an import, particularly when a source lacks an exact image ID, rarity, or localized set code. → [Import Tools guide](docs/ImportTools.md)

### 🧩 DB Editor

The DB Editor changes cached reference metadata, not the owned-card hierarchy embedded in a collection. It is useful for newly announced cards, missing promotional cards, incorrect set data, and Cardmarket references. Back up `data/` before large manual edits. → [Database Editor guide](docs/DBEditor.md)

## 📷 The card scanner

Point a webcam at a card, capture it in the browser, and let a fully local computer-vision pipeline do the identification — no image ever leaves your machine. 🔒

### Physical setup

Scanner accuracy depends more on your capture environment than on any single model setting:

1. Mount the camera so it is stable and approximately parallel to the card.
2. Place the entire card on a plain, matte surface with strong border contrast.
3. Use bright, diffuse, indirect lighting.
4. Avoid direct reflections from sleeves and foil patterns.
5. Grant camera permission to the browser and close other applications using the camera.

A light background can work well with the preprocessing mode optimized for light surfaces; a dark playmat can work better for light card borders. Use the Debug Lab to see which choice produces a clean contour on your hardware.

### How it processes a card

```text
Browser capture
    ↓
Edge or YOLO card detection
    ↓
Perspective correction and region extraction
    ↓
EasyOCR / DocTR text recognition
    ↓
Edition, rarity, type, and art analysis
    ↓
Heuristic candidate scoring
    ↓
Automatic result or ambiguity dialog
```

Processing runs on a dedicated worker thread so the UI never blocks, and the **Debug Lab** lets you compare preprocessing modes, OCR engines, and matching thresholds while inspecting every intermediate image.

📖 The full walkthrough — hardware tips, the weighted matching algorithm, Debug Lab controls, and scanner-specific troubleshooting — lives in the [Card Scanning guide](docs/CardScanning.md).

## 💾 Local data, backups, and offline use

There is no SQL or NoSQL database. Persistent application state is stored in ordinary files, primarily beneath `data/`.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `data/collections/` | Collection JSON/YAML files and uploaded storage images |
| `data/decks/` | `.ydk` deck files and deck-group directories |
| `data/db/` | Cached card and set metadata |
| `data/images/` | Lazy or bulk-downloaded card images and art-match source images |
| `data/sets/` | Cached set artwork |
| `data/banlists/` | Downloaded and custom banlists |
| `data/prices/` | Local pricing caches |
| `data/changelogs/` | Collection and deck operation history used by undo workflows |
| `data/scans/` | Temporary scan-session data and captured diagnostics |
| `data/ui_state.json` | Last selections, filters, and view preferences |
| `data/scanner_config.json` | Scanner track and threshold preferences |
| `data/.storage_secret` | Auto-generated session-signing secret |
| `config.json` | Application settings and the hashed local-account password |

The entire `data/` tree and `config.json` are ignored by Git because they are installation-specific and may contain private inventory or security state.

### 🛟 Backing up

1. Stop OpenYuGi so no write is in progress.
2. Copy `data/` and `config.json` to a versioned backup location.
3. Protect the backup like the original: it contains inventory, pricing, settings, and session/authentication material.

If space is limited, `data/images/` and `data/sets/` can usually be excluded because they can be downloaded again. Keep `data/collections/`, `data/decks/`, and any custom database or banlist content you cannot recreate.

> Test important backups by restoring them into a separate OpenYuGi checkout. A backup that has never been restored is only an assumption. 😉

### The collection data model

The collection hierarchy separates card identity, printing identity, and physical copies:

```text
Collection
└── CollectionCard                 base card identity (`card_id`)
    └── CollectionVariant          set + rarity + artwork (`variant_id`)
        └── CollectionEntry        condition + language + edition + location
```

This structure is what lets OpenYuGi keep alternate artworks distinct for collectors while still resolving gameplay counts back to the base card. The complete model — field-by-field notes and an annotated collection JSON example — is documented in **[Architecture & Data Model](docs/Architecture.md#collection-data-model)**.

> ⚠️ Do not edit a collection file while OpenYuGi is running; the next application save may overwrite the external change.

## 🔒 Configuration and security

OpenYuGi uses a single local account and session-based authentication. UI pages, API routes, debug routes, and application data routes are all protected by the authentication middleware.

- Default credentials are `admin` / `admin` — **change them first thing.**
- Passwords are stored as salted scrypt hashes in `config.json`, never as plaintext.
- Changing credentials invalidates existing authenticated sessions.
- `data/.storage_secret` signs sessions and is created with restrictive file permissions where the platform supports them.
- OpenYuGi does not configure TLS. If you expose it beyond localhost, place it behind a correctly configured HTTPS reverse proxy and restrict network access.

### Environment overrides

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENYUGI_ADMIN_USERNAME` | Override the configured login username |
| `OPENYUGI_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` | Override the configured Werkzeug-compatible password hash |
| `OPENYUGI_STORAGE_SECRET` | Provide a stable session secret of at least 32 characters |
| `OPENYUGI_SECURE_COOKIES` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` when serving exclusively through HTTPS |
| `OPENYUGI_ENABLE_DEBUG_STATIC` | Expose the local `debug/` directory at `/debug`; use only for controlled debugging |

The local-first model keeps collection data on your machine, but some actions intentionally contact external services, including YGOPRODeck, Yugipedia, Cardmarket pages, and banlist sources. OpenYuGi does not pretend stale data is current just to stay offline.

## 🏗️ Architecture

OpenYuGi is a server-rendered Python application built with **NiceGUI**, **FastAPI**, **Pydantic**, and local filesystem persistence.

| Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/core/` | Domain models, configuration, persistence, constants, and changelogs; no UI code |
| `src/services/` | Collection mutation, APIs, authentication, pricing, images, imports, storage, and other integrations |
| `src/services/scanner/` | Computer-vision models, pipeline, worker manager, and scan events |
| `src/ui/` | NiceGUI pages, layout, theme, and page controllers |
| `src/ui/components/` | Reusable card, filter, structure-deck, and ambiguity components |
| `src/api/` | Authenticated FastAPI request models and `/api/v1` routes |
| `tests/` | Automated test suite |
| `docs/` | Feature guides and screenshots |
| `data/` | Runtime user data and caches; ignored by Git |

At a high level, every inventory change loads a `Collection` Pydantic model, goes through `CollectionEditor`, records a changelog operation, and is written back as a full replacement file before the UI refreshes. Background work — network calls, heavy computation, the scanner pipeline — is kept off the NiceGUI event loop.

📐 The full technical deep dive — the six core implementation rules, the collection transaction flow, drag-and-drop internals, the authenticated `/api/v1` surface, the scanner threading model, and the complete on-disk data model — lives in **[Architecture & Data Model](docs/Architecture.md)**.

## 🛠️ Development

### Run from source

```bash
python main.py
```

Always run commands from the repository root. Relative paths such as `data/collections/` and `config.json` are intentional.

### Run tests

Install pytest if your development environment does not already provide it:

```bash
python -m pip install pytest
python -m pytest tests/
```

Tests must isolate user data in temporary directories. Mock NiceGUI, OpenCV, network requests, and other optional or heavyweight integrations where the test does not specifically exercise them. Never write test fixtures into the real `data/` directory.

### Build a distributable application

The repository's cross-platform workflows package OpenYuGi with PyInstaller. To make the same one-directory build locally:

```bash
python -m pip install pyinstaller
python build.py
```

Build output is written beneath `dist/OpenYuGi/`. Platform-specific binaries should be built on their target operating system.

### Contribution workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a focused branch from `main`.
2. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the [`docs/`](docs/Home.md) guide for the subsystem you intend to change.
3. Keep domain logic in `src/core/` or `src/services/`; keep presentation in `src/ui/`.
4. Add or update isolated tests for behavioral changes.
5. Run `python -m pytest tests/` from the repository root.
6. Check `git diff` for generated images, logs, caches, local data, and credentials before committing.
7. Open a pull request that explains the problem, solution, verification, and any new dependencies or migration concerns.

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

Quick fixes for the most common snags are below. For scanner-specific issues and more operating help, see the [FAQ & Troubleshooting guide](docs/FAQ_Troubleshooting.md).

<details>
<summary><strong>The application does not start</strong></summary>

- Confirm the virtual environment is active and rerun `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run `python main.py` from the repository root.
- Read the terminal output and `logs/app.log` for the first exception.
- If port 8084 is already occupied, stop the other process before restarting OpenYuGi.
- If `config.json` is invalid, move it aside while OpenYuGi is stopped and restart to generate defaults. Keep the old file until any needed settings are recovered.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>ModuleNotFoundError</code></strong></summary>

The usual causes are an inactive virtual environment, an incomplete dependency installation, or launching from another working directory. Activate the environment, install `requirements.txt`, and run from the checkout root.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Images are missing</strong></summary>

- Check the network connection for an image that has not been cached.
- Confirm the process can write to `data/images/` and `data/sets/`.
- Use the corresponding download action in Settings to prefetch images.
- Rebuild the scanner art index after replacing art-match images.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Saving reports <code>PermissionError</code> or <code>Access denied</code></strong></summary>

Close editors that have the collection file open and temporarily pause software that locks files, such as aggressive antivirus scanning or cloud-sync clients. OpenYuGi retries short-lived Windows replacement failures, but it cannot save through a persistent external lock.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The UI freezes during a development change</strong></summary>

A synchronous file operation, network request, or CPU-heavy task is probably running in the NiceGUI event loop. Move it to `await run.io_bound(...)`, use an async client, or use the scanner-style worker and event queue.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The camera is black or unavailable</strong></summary>

- Grant camera permission in the browser and operating system.
- Close Zoom, Discord, OBS, or other applications using the camera.
- Refresh the Scan page after permissions change.
- Use localhost or HTTPS; browsers may restrict cameras in insecure non-local contexts.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The scanner cannot find the card</strong></summary>

- Make the full card visible with a contrasting, uncluttered background.
- Reduce sleeve and foil glare with diffuse side lighting.
- Check the contour and warped-card output in Debug Lab.
- Compare classic and YOLO preprocessing.
- Confirm OCR/model dependencies imported successfully.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A database or banlist refresh fails</strong></summary>

These operations depend on external services and their current response formats. Preserve the existing local cache, check the network and logs, and retry later rather than deleting usable data immediately.
</details>
